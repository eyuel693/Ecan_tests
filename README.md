# Ecan_tests
Overview
This repository contains two test suites designed to validate the functionalities of two core components of the OpenCog framework:

ForgettingAgentTest: A suite to test the behavior of the ForgettingAgent class, which is responsible for managing and forgetting atoms based on their truth values and other parameters.

RentCollectionBaseAgentTest: A suite to test the functionality of the RentCollectionBaseAgent class, which manages rent collection based on available funds in the AttentionBank.

Both test suites are designed using the CxxTest framework and are intended to ensure that the agents operate as expected by simulating different conditions and asserting correct behaviors.
